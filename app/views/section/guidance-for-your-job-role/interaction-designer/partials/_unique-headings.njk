  Unique headings
</h3>
<p>
  Every page should have a unique heading. Don't have multiple pages with 
  the same vague H1, for example: "Your details". 
</p>
<p>
  Think about the journey as a whole. Consider the page that came before or 
  the one that comes after.
</p>
<p>
  If a screenreader user submits some information on one page, but the heading 
  on the following page is the same, they may think the page has 
  not changed, even if it's obvious to a sighted user that it has.
