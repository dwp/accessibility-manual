Never use pictures of words as a replacement for actual words. This can get very confusing for people who are using screenreaders and it can make the words blurry if somebody is using a screen magnifier.

If you want to make your words look fancy, change the font. This way assistive technology can still read it, and people can always change the font if they can't read it.
