### Colour contrast
When using colour, you should make sure the contrast ratios are strong enough for people who might have visual impairments.

If you use soft contrasts, such as pastel colours on a white background, then some people will simply not be able to see the words.

Make sure the colour contrast is sufficient between text and surrounding elements. It should be 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for large text.

Large text is anything over 18pt, or bold text which is larger than 14pt.
Normal text is anything under 18pt and is not bold.

You can use the [WebAim Colour Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to make sure your colour combinations are accessible.
