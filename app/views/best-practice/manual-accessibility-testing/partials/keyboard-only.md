### Keyboard only

As part of your manual tests you need to make sure the page works as expected using [just a keyboard](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#testing). Every part of the page must be able to be viewed, and every interactive element must be usable.

Links and form fields can be navigated using the tab key to go to the next item or shift + tab to move the previous one. Radio buttons can usually be navigated with arrow keys.

It must be obvious which element is focused ready to be interacted with. It should be visually different to other elements of the same type. For example, you might highlight a link with a border and a background colour. The highlight colour must have a 3:1 contrast ratio with any adjacent elements as focus styles are a common failure.

If the focus disappears off the screen at any point this is also a failure. If you have dynamic content or pop-ups you must make sure the focus does not get contained in a collapsed section or disappear behind a pop-up.
