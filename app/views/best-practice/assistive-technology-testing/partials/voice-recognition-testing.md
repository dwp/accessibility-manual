### Voice recognition testing

Every page should be tested using voice recognition software. If you're using Apple devices you can use [Voice Control](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/mobility/) for free, and if you're using Windows then you can use [Speech Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571) for free.
