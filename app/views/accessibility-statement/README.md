This website was last tested week commencing 20 September 2020\. The test was carried out by DWP using a combination of automated and manual testing.

The manual is on a modified version of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) which has already been accessibility audited. Additionally, We did automated and technical testing on each page template. This is to check the code and the content against each of the WCAG criteria.
