# {Images: }Impact on users

## Blind user

Roni is blind and has recently started working in the department. They have JAWS set up on their work computer and are trying to learn how to use various work applications. 

Unfortunately, the user guides are full of screenshots to support the instructions, but Roni's screen reader keeps announcing a graphic with dimensions but no other information. This is because the screenshots have no alt text. This results in Roni not being confident to use many of the applications they need to access things like pay slips, IT support and mandatory training.

## Low vision

Pierre has a degenerative eye condition and needs to zoom into around 400% to read webpages. They find it difficult to see some images, especially if they are low quality and do not zoom well. If the image has alternate text, they can use Narrator to access it.

Pierre often finds that images are used to present text such as quotes, motivational statements or where a particular font is used. Even when the quality is good, this is difficult for them to read, as the text does not reflow and they have to scroll vertically and horizontally to read it.
