# {Links and buttons: }Impact on users

## Blind user

Hajira is blind and uses JAWS at home and at work. It is important that they can work efficiently and one of the ways they achieve this is by asking JAWS to display a list of links and/or buttons when a webpage loads.

When all the links are meaningful, it is easy for Hajira to follow them and access information quickly but links or buttons such as 'click here' or 'read more' don't mean anything out of context.

## Mobility impairment

Harry is a veteran, who lost both arms in a bomb attack. They use voice recognition software to use a computer and access the Internet. When they open a webpage, they skim through quickly, using the 'Start scrolling' command and then stop to activate links and buttons using 'Click + name'. 

If links and buttons are coded correctly, Harry can quickly and easily move between webpages and find the information they need. They find it particularly frustrating when something looks like a button but behaves like a link, as this takes them away from the information they are trying to interact with.

## Cognitive impairment

Jackie has several cognitive impairments which make it difficult for them to learn to do basic tasks online. Their support worker has spent a lot of time helping them practise navigating webpages and they can now use navigation menus to move between pages. They have software that reads the content as they highlight it with their mouse.

Jackie is easily frustrated and gives up if content does not behave in a predictable manner. They find it helpful if navigation links within a site are always in the same order and if buttons that perform the same action always have the same name. If either of these is not the case, they are not able to understand it and they have to wait until someone can help them. This takes away their independence and makes them feel like a child.
