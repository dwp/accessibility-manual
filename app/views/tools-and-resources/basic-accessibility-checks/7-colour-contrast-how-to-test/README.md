## Colour contrast

### How to check colour contrast

To check the colour contrast, you will need the hexadecimal colour codes for the background and foreground colours. If either of these is a multicoloured image, take the colour where the contrast is at its lowest (lightest colour compared with white or darkest colour compared with black). Insert the colour codes into the relevant fields in the contrast checker and press enter. This will result in a contrast ratio and several pass/fail results.

### What to check

The colour contrast ratio required for compliance depends on the size of text:

	- Large text - 18pt or larger - minimum 3:1
	- Large text - 14pt and bold or larger - minimum 3:1
	- Normal text - smaller than large - minimum 4.5:1
	- Non-text elements - minimum 3:1
	- Focus styles - minimum 3:1

When looking at the pass/fail indicators on the contrast checker, remember that Public Sector Bodies must comply at AA level.
