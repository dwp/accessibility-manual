## Visual impairment

Juan is blind and uses a screen reader. When they navigate webpages, they can sometimes get lost, with several tabs open. It is important to have a way of knowing what each webpage is about. 

Juan uses the command <kbd>JAWS + T</kbd> to ask their screen reader to read the title of each webpage. This enables them to move between webpages to access the right information.

## Cognitive impairment

Casey is dyslexic and finds it difficult to read text when they have many webpages open. To help, they rely on the title tab to know which page is which. 

Casey finds it very confusing when several webpages on a site have the same or similar titles but they find it easier when the titles indicate what that page is about.
