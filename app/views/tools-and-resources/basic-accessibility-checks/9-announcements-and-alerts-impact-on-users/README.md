## Blind user
Sam has advanced macular degeneration and is almost completely blind. They can vaguely detect changes in light, so they are aware there is a screen in front of them, but they cannot see anything on it.

Sam uses a screen reader to navigate websites and relies heavily on being able to detect changes in state.

For example, Sam can easily make mistakes when filling out forms. It is important that Sam can quickly understand an error has occurred, identify the field which caused the error, and how to fix it.

Sam also relies on audible announcements for things like notifications. Because they cannot see the usual visual icons like red dots and banners, it needs to be announced by the screen reader that there is a new piece of information or that a process such as uploading a document is now complete.

A particular challenge for Sam is that modern websites are often very dynamic. The content is often hidden in expandable sections and pop-up modals. If these are not announced by the screen reader, then they can miss out on important information.
