# {Images: }Technical considerations

## Alternate text

Images should be coded in html using the `<img>` tag, with attributes for the source and alt text. The alt text should be concise and describe the image accurately. 

```html
<img src="image.png" alt="Man wearing a helmet and leather jacket"/>
```

If the image is decorative, the alt attribute should be empty.

```html
<img src="background-image.png" alt=""/>
```
