# {Automated tools: }Impact on users

Valid code benefits **all** users. It prevents crashes and other page errors. It ensures that your content will work with all the latest browsers and with assistive technology. 

A lot of automated HTML checkers will find missing closing tags, but may not find invalid roles or missing aria-attributes. It is important to check your website with assistive technologies to make sure they behave properly.

For screen reader users, if the HTML is not valid it can cause what is read out to be disjointed or for the pronunciation to be incorrect.

For voice controller users, it can cause buttons or links to be unusable without using complex commands.

For keyboard users, using the incorrect elements or event triggers can cause them to be un-focusable or unusable.
