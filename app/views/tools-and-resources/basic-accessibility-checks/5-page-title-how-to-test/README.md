# {Page title: }How to test

These tests can be conducted using any browser on a PC or laptop.

There are two ways you can test this criterion:

1. Visually check the browser tab
2. Use a screen reader.

## Check the browser tab

The browser tab should have a meaningful title which describes the content of the page and the service it is a part of. 

If the title is too long to fit on the tab, hovering the mouse over the tab will display the whole title.

## Use a screen reader

### Windows 10/11

Open the Narrator app. With the web page as the active window, press <kbd>INSERT + T</kbd> and the page title will be read aloud. Check that the title is unique, describes the page content and gives the service it is a part of.

If you have access to JAWS, the command to read the title is the same.

### MacBook

Turn VoiceOver on, either through the settings menu or by pressing <kbd>CMD + F5</kbd>.

Press <kbd>CTRL + OPTION + SHIFT + I</kbd> to read out the page title.
