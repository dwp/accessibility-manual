# {Colour contrast: }Impact on users

## Low vision

Liz didn't have any difficulty with reading until they were in their fifties, when their close vision began to deteriorate. Now, she finds it very difficult to read from screens, often needing to increase the font size. They had never even thought about colour contrast being a problem until it happened to them. Now they constantly find that text with low contrast is impossible to read, even when they increase the size.

When reading webpages with good colour contrast, Liz is able to concentrate for long periods of time and complete most tasks quite easily. When the contrast is poor, they get tired quickly and often experience headaches.

## Colour blindness

Paulo has been colour blind from birth. They don't really think about it most of the time, until they encounter something with poor colour contrast. They tend to just ignore it if it isn't something that directly affects them but if it is an essential service, this causes a lot of stress, as they cannot make out the different colours. Colour contrasts involving reds and greens are particularly difficult for Paulo to see.
