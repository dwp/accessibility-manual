# {Page title: }Technical considerations

## Page title

The page title is marked up with an `<html>` tag in the `<head>` section of the page. It must have a start and end tag, and the text between the tags must be meaningful.

```html
<title>Page title: Technical considerations</title>
```

In most circumstances, the page title and the main `<h1>` heading on the page will be the same.
