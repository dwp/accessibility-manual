# {Colour contrast: }Technical considerations

If you are using [GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/) you can use all of the responsive styles, layouts and components in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

## Colour contrast

### Text sizes

Font sizes are given in points (pt) on the How to test page. Should we also include other measures of font size? I know pixels are discouraged. How would this apply to em/rem measures?

### Non-text items

### Focus styles

A WCAG criterion for minimum focus contrast will be required when WCAG 2.2 is published. Although it is not yet a legal requirement, it is still best practice and you are advised to adopt this now in preparation for WCAG 2.2.

The current focus style for the Gov.uk sites has two components. The yellow background colour is known to fail the contrast test. However, the second part is a thick black underline/border box and this means that a passing focus style is achieved.
