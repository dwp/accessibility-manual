# {Keyboard accessibility: }Impact on users

## Blind
Jiayi is blind and uses a screen reader to access digital content. They use a keyboard with Braille display to navigate and interact with web pages. Jiayi finds it easy to navigate websites which have a logical structure and order. They can use the keyboard to listen to content and then interact with links, buttons and forms as they choose.

On some websites, links and buttons cannot be accessed without a mouse. This causes confusion for Jiayi, as they cannot see the content, not access it via their screen reader. This results in important information being missed and can prevent them from completing important tasks.

## Low vision
Pat is finding that as they get older, they are less able to focus on small text. They particularly struggle when required to click on small items on screen, such as check boxes and radio buttons. When Pat was shown how to use their keyboard to navigate, they found this very helpful and it gave them confidence to continue using online systems for important tasks. By using the <kbd>TAB</kbd> and <kbd>ENTER</kbd> keys, Pat can move more accurately between items and input the required information.

Pat finds it frustrating when the focus indicator is missing or has low contrast, as they cannot see where they are on the page. This means they do not know when to activate an element in order to move to another page or open more information.

Webpages that have lots of menu items can be difficult for Pat as they have to tab many times to get to the desired place on the page. They find it much easier when a Skip to main content link has been provided, especially if this is the first item that is given focus when tabbing.

## Hand tremor
Niko has essential tremor, which affects their hands and arms. This makes it difficult to operate a mouse or keyboard as they cannot control movement and clicks. Voice recognition software makes online tasks much easier for them. Niko gives voice commands which simulate keyboard navigation. As well as using the commands <kbd>TAB</kbd> and PRESS <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, they can view all the links on a page and then select by choosing one. They can also say CLICK + the name of a link or button. This makes it much more efficient than only using a keyboard.

On some sites, Niko can see a button or link but cannot access it by tabbing, showing all links or by name. This prevents them from accessing information that other people can access. Niko sometimes leaves a website because it hasn't been made accessible but if the task is essential, Niko has to find someone to help them, which takes away their independence.

## Cognitive
Jay has always found reading difficult. They have learned some strategies to help them but struggle when there is a lot of text on a page. Jay uses a web extension that lists all the headings and/or links on a webpage. This allows them to find the required information more quickly and easily.

Once they are reading the text, Jay sometimes loses their place and uses the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to find the next or last focus item. This helps them to process the information in manageable chunks.
