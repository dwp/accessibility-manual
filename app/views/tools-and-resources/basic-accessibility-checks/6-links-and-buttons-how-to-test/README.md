# {Links and buttons: }How to test

These tests can be conducted using any browser on a PC or laptop.

## What is the difference between a link and a button?

It is essential that links and buttons are coded correcty and that users can activate them, expecting a predictable response.

A link should look like a link and should take the user to another page or to another section within the page.

A button should look like a button and should perform an action. 

## How to test links and buttons

If you tab through the page, each link and button should receive focus. This will enable you to test each one individually. You should check for the following:

- The purpose of each link and button is clear - the text on the page should be meaningful rather than generic, e.g. 'Accessibility Guidelines' rather than 'Click here'.
- No broken or internal-only links - check that each link goes to the page you intended and that the page still exists.
- Navigation menus on more than one page are in the same order - this should be automatic if you are using GOV.UK Frontend.
- Buttons on more than one page are labelled consistently - the name of the button should be correctly coded to ensure that voice-to-text users can click the button by name.
- Button icons have a text alternative - the alt text should be the name of the button, i.e. what a voice-to-text user would say in order to activate it.
