# {Headings and labels: }Impact on users

## Cognitive

Andi had an accident which resulted in a brain injury. They now find reading more difficult and struggle to retain and process information. When accessing online information, they find it helpful if there are clear headings which indicate what the content will be about, so that they can predict what the section will contain. This helps them remember the information better.

Andi also finds it difficult when filling in online forms. They find it much easier when clear instructions are provided to explain what information is required, especially if examples are given. Things like date and time fields cause particular challenges, as Andi is never sure what format is required without some kind of example. When submitting forms, they often give up if there is an error identified, unless it is really clear why the error occurred and how they can fix it.

## Visual impairment

Jan has glaucoma which has caused them to gradually lose their sight over several years. Although they initially used screen magnification, they have now started using a screen reader for most tasks. When Jan could access webpages by sight, they would often skim read through headings to find the information they were interested in reading. They were pleased to realise that their screen reader could read all the headings in a similar way, so that they could then access a particular section. When headings have not been marked up correctly, this doesn't work. When this happens, Jan usually just closes the webpage and looks elsewhere.

Jan is still new to using a screen reader and one of the things they find most difficult is tables. They often have to do examine the information multiple times to make sense of it. They have noticed that some tables are easier to process than others, when the table headers are clear and the screen reader tells them whether it is the column or row that it relates to.
