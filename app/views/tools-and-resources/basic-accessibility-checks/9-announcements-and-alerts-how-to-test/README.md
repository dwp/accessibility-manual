# {Announcements and alerts: }How to test

These tests can be conducted using any browser on a PC or laptop.

## Error identification

Errors include omissions of data and data which does not match the required format. When an error is identified, it is essential that it is read by a screen reader.

To test this, you will need to use a screen reader. You could use:

- JAWS
- NVDA
- VoiceOver

Test for both omitted information and invalid information. When the form is submitted and the error message appears on the screen, the screen reader should move to the error message and read it first.
