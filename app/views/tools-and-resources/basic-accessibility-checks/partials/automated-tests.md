You must use automated tools to spot any common mistakes.

If automated tools are flagging issues, it's usually a pretty good sign your application is not ready to be thoroughly audited for accessibility.

There are a few cases where you might get false positives. For example your skip link may not be contained by a landmark. On a page which meets WCAG 2.1 to the standard of AA, it is very unlikely an automated tool would find more than 5 separate issues.
