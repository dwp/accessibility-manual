# {Session timeouts: }Impact on users

## Timing adjustable
Chris has Cerebral Palsy. He often finds his movements are jerky which can make using a mouse difficult. 

Chris uses a combination of a voice controller and a keyboard for most interactions. He uses a keyboard for simple interactions and to navigate around, but he finds typing out words can be frustrating and prefers to use a voice controller for that.

On bad days, Chris's voice controller does not always understand what he is saying, and it can take him a few attempts to get it right. This slows him down considerably when filling in online forms and can cause some online forms to timeout, meaning Chris has to start again.

For Chris, he needs enough time to be able to complete his tasks without losing any data. If there is a session timeout, then he needs to be able to easily extend it without having to start again.
