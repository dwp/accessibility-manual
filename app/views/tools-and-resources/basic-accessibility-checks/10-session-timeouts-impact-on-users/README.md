# {Session timeouts: }Impact on users

## Motor impairment
Chris has Cerebral Palsy. He often finds his movements are jerky which can make using a mouse difficult. 

Chris uses a combination of a voice controller and a keyboard for most interactions. He uses a keyboard for simple interactions and to navigate around, but he finds typing out words can be frustrating and prefers to use a voice controller for that.

On bad days, Chris's voice controller does not always understand what he is saying and it can take him a few attempts to get it right. This slows him down considerably when filling in online forms and can cause some online forms to timeout, meaning Chris has to start again.

For Chris, he needs enough time to be able to complete his tasks without losing any data. If there is a session timeout, then he needs to be able to easily extend it without having to start again.

## Visual impairment
Deepti has lost most her sight due to an injury. She uses a screen reader to navigate around the web but she struggles to understand it unless it is on a slow setting.

Deepti is confident when pages are static, but sometimes struggles with websites that update in real-time or load in dynamic content.

For Deepti, she needs enough time to complete her tasks, to be alerted if that time is about to expire and for the interaction to extend it to be clear and simple.
