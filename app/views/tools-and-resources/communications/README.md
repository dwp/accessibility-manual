# Communications

Accessibility testing often applies to webpages, applications and online tools. However, within DWP, colleagues at all levels send out communications in the form of:

- Word documents
- PowerPoint presentations/slide decks
- Emails
- PDFs.

This section will provide guidance to help you to ensure that your communications are as accessible as possible.

Remember: **It is not only DWP customers that have disabilities and use assistive technologies; many of our employees do too.** Please always consider that your communications may be received by a colleague who is using assistive technology as part of their work life.
