## Headings and other visual information

When a sighted person looks at a document, they subconsciously take in a lot of visual information, such as:

- Headings and subheadings
- Lists (bulleted and numbered)
- Tables.

In order to make a Word document accessible, these visual items need to be created correctly, so that a screen reader can access them and read out structural information.

### Choosing a design

Word has many built-in heading styles and their formatting depends on the **design** that is selected. You may want to choose a different design before working on headings. The following video will show you how to select a different design, along with colours and fonts.

### Styling and modifying headings

Text and video here.

### Lists

Screen readers read out both bulleted and numbered lists, first stating that it is a list, then the number of items. The information will be clearer if standard black, round bullet points are used and numbers as digits. Please avoid using fancy bullet points or Roman numerals.

### Tables

Tables should only be used to display data. Never use tables for layout. Layout will be covered in a later section.
