# Accessibility posters

## Home office posters

The accessibility team at the Home Office published a blog post called '[Dos and don'ts on designing for accessibility](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)'. The post was to promote a range of posters which could help people design more accessible services. 

The [Home Office accessibility posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility) are free to download and provide tips on designing for different impairments.
