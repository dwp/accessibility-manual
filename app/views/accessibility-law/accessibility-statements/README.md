# Accessibility statements

An accessibility statement is a page of content on your service which:
- shows people how we can be confident our services are accessible
- allows people to contact us if they get stuck
- stops people wasting their time if they won't be able to use the service
- empowers people to hold us accountable if we are not fulfilling our responsibilities
- helps our services to be legally compliant

There is a recommended format for accessibility statements in Government. GDS have created two templates:
- [<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">accessibility statement </span>template for GOV.UK services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/publishing-information-about-your-services-accessibility")
- [<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">accessibility statement</span> template for a public sector website which is not part of GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website)

There is also [additional guidance on accessibility statements on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#publish-your-accessibility-statement).

## Accessibility statements and the law

Under [regulation 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/8/made) in the [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) it states that all public sector websites must provide an accessibility statement.

Under the legislation, an accessibility statement must:
- be provided in an accessible format
- be published on the website of the public sector body
- include an explanation of any features which are not accessible and why
- outline any accessible alternatives
- provide a method of contact so people can report issues or request information
- outline the enforcement procedure
