There is a difference between being legally compliant and having a service which works for everyone. Legal compliance is the bare minimum, but it doesn't guarantee your service will work for all your users.

The [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) is more specific in what you need to do to make your service accessible. There is an additional two criteria you must meet. This is called the [Government Accessibility Requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#meeting-government-accessibility-requirements).

## The Accessibility Regulations

To be legally compliant your service needs to:
- meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](/section/accessibility-and-the-law/web-content-accessibility-guidelines)
- publish a compliant [accessibility statement](/section/accessibility-and-the-law/accessibility-statements)

You can read a more in depth explanation about the [accessibility regulations](/section/accessibility-and-the-law/accessibility-regulations) in this manual.
