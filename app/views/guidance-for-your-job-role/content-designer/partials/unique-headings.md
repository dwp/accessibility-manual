### Unique headings

Every page should have a unique heading. Don't have multiple pages with the same vague H1, for example: "Your details".

Think about the journey as a whole. Consider the page that came before or the one that comes after.

If a screenreader user submits some information on one page, but the heading on the following page is the same, they may think the page has not changed, even if it's obvious to a sighted user that it has.
