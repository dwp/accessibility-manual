You can refer to the page [URL guidance in the Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/writing-for-user-interfaces#urls).
 
The page purpose should be clear from the URL. URLs are often overlooked as something that should be designed. But theyâ€™re an important part of accessibility as they can orientate users. They can also make content easier to find if a user needs to come back later.

An example of a good url is:
```text
/guidance/help-with-your-tax-return
```

An example of a bad url is:
```text
/user/5625665526/post/87837847.php
```
