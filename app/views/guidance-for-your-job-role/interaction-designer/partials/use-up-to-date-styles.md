### Use up to date styles

Using out of date styles means you might not be meeting the current standards. The GOV.UK styles were updated in [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) 3.0 to meet the WCAG 2.1 standards. If you're using the old styles your service will not be compliant.
