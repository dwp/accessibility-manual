### Make sure the team know their responsibilities

As the Product Manager, it is important that each member of the team takes responsibility for delivering an accessible service.

Everyone on the team has a role to play to make sure accessibility is considered and implemented at every phase of the project.

Often, there is a misconception that accessibility is a technical requirement and only affects developers and testers, but this is simply not true.

Make sure accessibility is covered in ceremonies such as sprint planning and sprint review, so the team know what considerations they must make and whether the delivered feature meets the standards.
