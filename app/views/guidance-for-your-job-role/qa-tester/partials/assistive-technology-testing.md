### Assistive technology testing

Each page needs to be tested with assistive technology devices. These are tools such as screenreaders, screen magnifiers and speech recognition software.

WCAG 2.1 outlines that websites must be robust and work on a range of assistive technologies. It does not specifically state which ones, but we should assume a range includes screenreaders, screen magnifiers and voice recognition as a minimum.

Some assistive technology requires a licence, but most devices have them built in and you can also get some for free. You can meet the [accessibility regulations](/section/accessibility-and-the-law/accessibility-regulations) using these tools, but if you're working to the GOV.UK Service Standard you will need to make sure your service works on very particular technologies. You can [read more about assistive technology testing and the GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).
