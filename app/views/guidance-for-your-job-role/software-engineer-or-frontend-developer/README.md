# Software Engineer or Frontend Developer

As an Software Engineer or Frontend Developer, you have one of the most important roles when it comes to accessibility. A design can have considered accessibility, but it's up to you to build it to work correctly.

By using existing libraries and frameworks such as GOV.UK Frontend and DWP CASA, you can get a lot of good practices for accessibility built in, however we need to be mindful of how we apply them.

<blockquote class="govuk-inset-text">
  Using GOV.UK Frontend does not mean your service automatically meets level AA of WCAG 2.1. You’ll still need to make sure your service as a whole meets accessibility requirements.

  From the [GOV.UK Accessibility statement information](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/#using-the-design-system-and-frontend-in-your-service)

## Working with others

You will need to work closely with [interaction designers](/guidance-for-your-job-role/interaction-designer) and [content designers](/guidance-for-your-job-role/content-designer) to make sure things like hover states, error messages and hidden text are considered.

You will also want to work with [QA Testers](/guidance-for-your-job-role/qa-tester) to make sure automated processes are in place for checking things with tools like aXe and putting in place accessibility criteria are part of your definition of done.
