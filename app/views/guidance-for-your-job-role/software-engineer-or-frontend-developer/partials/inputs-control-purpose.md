## Inputs control purpose

Adding autocomplete attributes to certain fields helps browsers auto-fill personal information. This can be useful for a person with memory related disabilities, motor impairments, or people where English is not their first language.

As part of [1.3.5: Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) we need to look at which fields may need autocomplete attributes to help users complete the service. For example, the [autocomplete attribute for a date of birth](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/#use-the-autocomplete-attribute-for-a-date-of-birth).

Autocomplete attributes are intended to be used when people are entering their own personal information. For internal systems where staff are inputting other peoples details, we should not use autocomplete attributes as it could lead to the wrong information being entered accidentally.

A [recommended autocomplete attribute list](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes) shows which fields we might need to use autocomplete on, including attributes like name, telephone number and passwords.
