### Page title

{% include '../../shared/page-title.md' %}

The standard format for titles on a service is to set the context in 3 parts and separate them using en dashes (not hyphens). The 3 parts are:  
`H1 – Service context – Domain context`.

For example:
```html
~~<title>What is your name? – Apply for Universal Credit – GOV.UK</title>
```

If there are errors on the page, then the page context part of the title should be prefixed with `Error:`. You can read more about this on the [GOV.UK pattern for validation errors](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/validation/).

You should work with a Content Designer and QA Tester to make sure the titles are correct when deciding if the page is finished.
