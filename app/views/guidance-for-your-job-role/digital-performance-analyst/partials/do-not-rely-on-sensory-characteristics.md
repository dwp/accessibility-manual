### Do not rely on sensory characteristics

Using sensory characteristics means you have structured your content in a way that means people are entirely reliant on a particular part of their body functioning correctly in order to perceive it. This is not ok.

For example, if you say 'use the menu on the right', you are assuming the user will always be looking at the page to be able to understand left from right.

When we look at a page and see it visually, we usually have access to 2 dimensions. X and Y. It means we can understand relative positions such as Left, right, up and down. But, if you're blind and using a screenreader, the page is 1 dimensional. It's linear. The content is just ordered first to last, so you have no way of being able to perceive left or right from your current position.

Always consider whether the content you are creating is reliant upon on shape, colour, size, visual location, orientation or sound. There should always be several ways to perceive the same information.

Examples of relying on sensory characteristics:

- Figure 14 shows us that...
- the triangles on the chart represent...
- as you can see from the red line on the graph...
- if you compare the horizontal bars to the vertical ones...
- the largest segment of the pie chart shows...
- if you look at the chart on the left you will see...
- when you hear the alarm it means new data is available...
- the clock icon represents time elapsed...
